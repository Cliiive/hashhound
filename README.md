## Overview

**HashHound** is a digital forensic analysis tool designed for investigating disk images by comparing file hashes against a reference database. It automates the process of identifying known files within evidence images and generates comprehensive forensic reports suitable for legal proceedings.

The tool is particularly useful for:
- Digital forensic investigations
- Identifying known files in disk images
- Generating professional documentation for court proceedings

## Disclaimer

HashHound performs automated analysis and can produce incorrect, incomplete, or misleading results. All findings must be manually verified and should not be treated as authoritative, legally reliable, or inherently true. Users are fully responsible for validating outputs before relying on them in investigative or legal contexts.

## Features

- **Automated Hash Analysis**: Searches disk images for files matching known hash values
- **Multiple Hash Algorithms**: Supports SHA-256, SHA-1, and MD5 hash comparison
- **Partition Support**: Analyzes both single filesystems and multi-partition disk images
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates professional PDF reports in German (suitable for legal proceedings)
- **Detailed Metadata Extraction**: Captures file timestamps, sizes, and paths
- **Real-time Progress Monitoring**: Visual feedback during analysis with statistics
- **TSK Integration**: Uses The Sleuth Kit (pytsk3) for robust filesystem analysis
- **Debug Mode**: Verbose logging for troubleshooting and detailed analysis

## Prerequisites

Before using HashHound, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.12+**
- **Required Python packages**:
  - `pytsk3` - The Sleuth Kit Python bindings for filesystem analysis
  - `sqlalchemy` - Database operations for hash database management
  - `reportlab` - PDF report generation
  - `argparse` - Command-line argument parsing (built-in)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cliiive/HashHound.git
   cd HashHound
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install pytsk3 sqlalchemy reportlab
   ```

   Or if you have a requirements file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Verify installation**:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py --help
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Command Structure

```bash
python src/main.py --evidence <path> --hash-db <path> --investigator "<name>" --output <path> [--debug]
```

### Command-Line Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `--evidence` | Yes | Path to the directory or disk image to be examined |
| `--hash-db` | Yes | Path to the hash database CSV file (VIC Hash Database format) |
| `--investigator` | Yes | First and last name of the investigator (for report header) |
| `--output` | Yes | Target path for the PDF report (must end with .pdf) |
| `--debug` | No | Enable debug mode for verbose output |

### Example Usage

**Basic forensic analysis**:
```bash
python src/main.py \
  --evidence /path/to/evidence.dd \
  --hash-db /path/to/vic_hashes.csv \
  --investigator "John Doe" \
  --output /path/to/reports/analysis_report.pdf
```

**With debug logging**:
```bash
python src/main.py \
  --evidence /mnt/evidence/disk_image.dd \
  --hash-db ./databases/hashes.db \
  --investigator "Jane Smith" \
  --output ./output/forensic_report.pdf \
  --debug
```

**Analyzing a directory**:
```bash
python src/main.py \
  --evidence /path/to/directory \
  --hash-db ./hashes.db \
  --investigator "Detective Brown" \
  --output ./report_$(date +%Y%m%d).pdf
```

## Workflow

1. **Preparation**: Prepare your evidence disk image and hash database
2. **Launch**: Run HashHound with appropriate arguments
3. **Review Parameters**: The tool displays your parameters and waits for confirmation
4. **Analysis**: HashHound scans the evidence image comparing file hashes
5. **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time statistics show files searched and matches found
6. **Report Generation**: A comprehensive PDF report is automatically generated
7. **Review**: Examine the generated forensic report

### Output

HashHound generates a professional forensic report in German that includes:

- **Report Header**: Investigator name, date, evidence path, case information
- **Executive Summary**: Overview of findings and methodology
- **Methodology Section**: Detailed description of analysis procedures
- **Findings Table**: Summary table of all matching files
- **Detailed Results**: Complete metadata for each finding including:
  - File name and path
  - File size
  - SHA-256 hash value
  - Created, modified, and accessed timestamps
  - Partition offset information
- **Technical Details**: Information about the analysis process and tools used
- **Signature Section**: Space for investigator certification

### Sample Console Output

```
Starting forensic analysis...

|| START TIME || ELAPSED    || FOUND FILES     || SEARCHED FILES  ||
||____________||____________||_________________||_________________||

```

## Hash Database Format

HashHound expects a SQLite database with a table named `VIC_HASHES` containing:

- Table: `VIC_HASHES`
- Column: `hash_value` (TEXT, PRIMARY KEY)

The database should contain hash values (SHA-256, SHA-1, or MD5) of known files to search for.

## Technical Details

### Hash Comparison
- HashHound computes SHA-256, SHA-1, and MD5 hashes for each file
- Compares computed hashes against the reference database
- Uses set intersection for efficient matching

### Filesystem Analysis
- Uses pytsk3 (The Sleuth Kit) for filesystem traversal
- Supports multiple partitions and partition tables
- Handles both raw filesystems and disk images with partition tables
- Extracts comprehensive file metadata including timestamps

### Report Generation
- Uses ReportLab for professional PDF generation
- Follows German legal standards for digital evidence documentation
- Includes all necessary information for court proceedings
- Automatically formats dates, file sizes, and technical details

## Limitations

- Hash database must be in the specified SQLite format
- Large disk images may take considerable time to process
- Some filesystem types may not be fully supported by pytsk3
- Reports are generated in German language only

## Security Considerations

- HashHound operates in read-only mode on evidence images
- No modifications are made to original evidence
- All operations are logged for audit trails
- Hash values ensure integrity of findings

## Troubleshooting

**Error: "Evidence directory does not exist"**
- Verify the path to your evidence file or directory
- Ensure you have read permissions

**Error: "Hash database file does not exist"**
- Check that the database path is correct
- Verify the database file exists and is readable

**Error: "Failed to connect to database"**
- Ensure the database is in SQLite format
- Check that the `VIC_HASHES` table exists

**No matches found**
- Verify that the hash database contains the hashes you're looking for
- Check that hash values in the database are lowercase
- Ensure the evidence image is accessible and not corrupted
